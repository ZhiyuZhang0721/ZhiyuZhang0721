- As a math lover, I'm also reading papers related to research on [intelligent algorithms](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/information-sciences).
- I'm interested in exploring system design and Web 3 related projects.
- You can contact me via the Gmail provided in my profile; I'm willing to communicate with you.
- Trying to be a YouTuber, though I have no idea what kind of videos I want to make.
- Always welcome good opportunities and fashionable tech.
