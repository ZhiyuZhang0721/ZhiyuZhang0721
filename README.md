Hi, I'm Anthony Zhang, currently a back-end software engineer in a game company. I focus on the maintenance and development of game servers and databases.

- I'm currently learning [CS186](https://cs186.gitbook.io/project/).
- As a math lover, I'm also reading papers related to research on [intelligent algorithms](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/information-sciences).
- I'm interested in exploring system design and Web 3 related projects.
- You can contact me by the gmail provided in my profile, I'm willing to communicate with you in Twitter.
- Trying to be a YouTuber, though I have no idea about what kind of videos I wanna make.
